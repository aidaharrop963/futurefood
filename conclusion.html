        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p2>How were your results? How did you feel about them? If you are surprised with them, do not worry because as humans, we do not realize how much and what types of food we consume on a daily basis. This survey was made to help us realize how much
            we usually eat so that we can make the decision to make a change for the better. In today's society, we know that we should eat "healthy", but there are so many temptations that prevent us from meeting the norm. Also, we do not know exactly
            what "healthy" is. With the future that is ahead of us, the evolution of food and technology would help us to acknowledge the fact that the majority needs to start taking more measures to eat a well-rounded diet that can benefit us and make
            us feel good about ourselves. Life is short and everything is evolving, so we should take advantage of what is in front of us so that we can enjoy life to the fullest. </p2>
