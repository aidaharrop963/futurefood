            <h1> FOOD </h1>
            <h6> The key to infamous happiness is Food. Food makes your day go from being boring and dull, to a magical place where you can feel you can do anything. As technology is advancing through time, so is our eating habits. Throughout the day we usually look through a screen, which gives us limited time to try and eat and get the needed nutrition we need in a day. People tend to get deceived by the image of a brand rather then looking at the nutrition facts, thinking that it's a “healthy” option.  From this, why not take a survey to see how “healthy” you really are! </h6>
