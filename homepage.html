            <h1>The Present Future of Food</h1>
            <h6>  Food is one of the many keys to happiness for some. It will make your day go from being boring and dull, to a magical place where you can feel like you can do anything. As technology advances with time, so does our eating habits. Throughout the day, we usually look through a screen that limits us to unhealthy food choices, which causes us to not get the nutrients that we need in a day. People tend to get deceived by the image of a brand rather than looking at the nutritional facts, thinking that it is “healthy” for them when it really is not.  Now that you know this, why not take a survey to see how “healthy” you really are?! </h6>
