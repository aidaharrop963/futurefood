# THE PRESENT FUTURE OF FOOD
## What this project does
This project allows you to see where your "health bar" is currently at and based on your results after taking the survey
 we would provide information which is helpful specifically for you.
 
## How we built it
We built this project by dividing the work, communicating and constantly bouncing ideas off each other.


## Challenges we ran into
We had our survey page disappear on us and stop working about 40 minutes before submission.
Pretty nerve racking but we figured it out last minutes. 

## What we learned 
We learned: 
-  Shortcuts for computer functions
-  link pages without javascript
-  Certain values and proprties in CSS
-  jQuery charts


## What's next for this project 
Our next thing include in this project is to include sites recommended for you based upon your results from the survey.
